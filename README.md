# Parrot
A python 3.12 program that mimics you to annoy you while you are trying to work.
It records you for 9 seconds, plays the audio file, deletes the wav file upon finishing playing, and then proceeds to do this allllll over again.
(That is unless you find your exit within the code... it's not that hard lol)
